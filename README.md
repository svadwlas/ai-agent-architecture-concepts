# AI Agent Architecture Concepts

This repository presents conceptual building blocks and architectural considerations for designing agentic systems powered by large language models (LLMs). The included deck outlines modular agent design patterns, use case planning, and LLM augmentation strategies (retrieval, tools, memory).

## 📊 Included Materials

- `AI-AGENTS-ARCHITECTURE.pptx` – A professional slide deck introducing core AI agent architecture principles
- Visual examples of:
  - LLM-based reasoning loops
  - Prompt chaining workflows
  - Tradeoffs between latency and task decomposition
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) + tool orchestration

## 🎯 Target Audience

- Enterprise architects, AI engineers, and product leaders exploring GenAI strategy
- Researchers or practitioners designing intelligent automation agents
- Candidates or contributors evaluating AI-agent frameworks like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Flowise

## 🛠️ Usage Ideas

- Reference for internal AI/LLM design discussions
- Executive explainer for platform vision
- Baseline to extend into code (e.g., [ai-agent-architecture-demo](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-agent-architecture-demo))
